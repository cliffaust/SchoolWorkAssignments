/* QUESTION 3
 3.The Fibonacci series 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, â€¦ begins with the terms 0 and 1
and has the property that each succeeding term is the sum of the two preceding terms. Write a method fibonacci( n ) 
that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. Incorporate this method into an application that enables the user to enter the value of n. 
(Hint: You may use the concept of recursion)
